Time Complexity: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O

Data structures playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu

Recursion Playlist by mycodeschool and video no. 18 to no. 29 from Abdul Bari's Algorithm Playlist to understand Masters Theorem for the proof of recursion.

Divide and Conquer
Implement merge sort, segment tree, binary search etc. And study Video no. 18, 33 to 38 from Abdul Bari Algorithm's Playlist
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O

Greedy
This is tough one. Proofing greedy algorithm is quite difficult. Studying known problems like knapsack, job schedule, optimal merge pattern, Huffman coding etc are enough to ace greedy questions. Study Video no.39-no.45 from Abdul Bari Algorithm's Playlist
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O

Backtracking & Branch and Bound
Study Video no.63 to no.71 from Abdul Bari Algorithm's Playlist. This topic is the key ingredient to solve Dynamic Programming questions.

I find Abdul bari's tutorial more effective and easy to follow. His style to teach students is quite exceptional. Suppose you are studying Longest Common Subsequence, first understand the question really good -> try to solve a small problem of the main problem -> try to solve a bit big problem with the help of solution and see if you can find any formula/pattern -> if you can't find any then read discussion/solution(only algorithm not code) and try to code it up after understanding -> If still doesn't work for you then watch the video of that topic from the playlist i have mentioned and try hard this time to understand and visualize the algorithm. -> You solved a DP Question! Yahoo!.

Now one of the most important study material for DP. How many of us know that a dynamic programming is nothing but a topological sort of problem dependency directed acyclic graph which means if you can generate a test case for a DP problem that has a cycle then that DP solution will fail for that cyclic graph. To know all of this cool things and understand DP really good then study:-

Comment: There are so much overlaps in between greedy, dp with graph theory. Say for example Dijkstra, Prim's and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning tree are just Greedy Algorithms or backtracking is just DFS with branch pruning with condition. So you will find it a lot easier after studying programming paradigm section. In fact graph problems are either so easy to recognize that everything is given so explicitly that any one can recognize it as a typical graph question or may be it's too hidden to even think it as a graph question. So my suggestion is to think out of the box for a problem, think if a problem can be solved by using graphs. Never forget that, Interviewers are just obsessed with binary tree, so try to solve as many questions as you can related to tree, specifically binary tree(and also n-ary tree). And also solve at least 20 questions with tag BFS and DFS in Leetcode which will definitely boost your tree and graph problem solving skill as graph traversal is the main toolkit to solve tree/graph problems in interview. That's all about graph.

MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Spring 2015 and also try to examine your understand through their quiz and exams from Mathematics for Computer Science MIT OCW main site.
And CP(or may be CI) guys must read the Algebra Section from here:-
English translation of e-maxx awesome algorithm text tutorial.

Others
1. String Processing: Follow the string section from CP Algorithms Site. https://cp-algorithms.com/
2. Bit Manipulation: Follow HackerEarth Bit Manipulation Tutorial and also Fun with Bits Tutorial. https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/bit-manipulation/basics-of-bit-manipulation/tutorial/
 I didn't cover the study materials for advanced DS like SegTree, Fenwick tree/ BIT, Sparse Matrix etc. And also some non trivial algorithms. Don't worry about these, you won't face them in an interview in 95% case at least for entry levels or a bit higher from entry
